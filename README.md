Increase Soul Spectral Card Probability to Spawn in Balatro

1 is 100% chance it will spawn Black Hole and Soul.  Increase the value to lower the chance. 100 would be a 1 in 100 chance.
1 will be a 100% chance of spectral packs having both of these.  Planet packs will contain a black hole 100%, and Tarot packs will 100% contain a Soul.  
Oddly, it only marginally increases the chance of Black Hole appearing inside of Tarot packs.
I did very basic work here without complete understanding of the impacts.
Once all legendary cards are owned, they will start to spawn the default joker.  This is base game behavior.
