Increase Soul Spectral Card Probability to Spawn in Balatro

- 1 is 100% chance it will spawn Soul.  Increase the value to lower the chance. 100 would be a 1 in 100 chance.
- 1 will be a 100% chance of spectral packs having Soul.
- Once all legendary cards are owned, they will start to spawn the default joker.  This is base game behavior.
