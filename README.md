Increase Soul Spectral Card Probability to Spawn in Balatro

- All cards that would be generated of the type specified (spectral, tarot, planet), it will have this chance applied to them.
- 1 is 100% chance it will spawn Soul.  Increase the value to lower the chance. 100 would be a 1 in 100 chance.
- 1 will be a 100% chance of spectral packs having Soul.
- Once all legendary cards are owned, they will start to spawn the default joker.  This is base game behavior.
